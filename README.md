# ***H*** *-------< hydrogen language >*
***an explicit, minimal, and readable abstraction.***

reimagining C in a vacuum, using short, explicit words from the average lexicon.
the goal is to maximize legibility and literal understanding upon initial code reading; the best hydrogen code is read and understood without the need for comments.

*H allows a more uniform, strong understanding of the computer's actions.*
### just bytes, types, references, and functions.

-------
## systematic rules and restrictions
- everything is just bytes and references.
- newly allocated bytes are zeroed.
- all `ref` types are constant and restricted.
- structs are packed, with descending-size components.
- text characters are unsigned bytes.
- function parameters are constant via `in`.
- all memory is contained and tracked.
